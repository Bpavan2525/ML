        "- the ability to learn patterns by the machine from the data and replicate the the same in future.\n",
        "- - the main components of machine learning are:\n",
        "- - data, model, training, evaluation, prediction, optimization.\n",

        "- continuous is which cannot be countable and is in numeric data and categorical means in string format.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "- we can convert data to numerical by using data encoding methods.\n",
        "- they are: one hot encoding, label encoding, ordinal encoding, target guided ordinal encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "- making the data fit is known as training and the fit makes the new data transform which is testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is `sklearn.preprocessing`?\n",
        "- it contains scaling modules where it can do preprocessing of data to make it less complex while training.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is a test set?\n",
        "- in a data set some of the data is removed aside to test the model after it's training to check the model's accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split wich is used to divide the data set to train the model and test the model on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        "- understanding the problem, gathering and preparing the data set, selecting appropriate model, training the model and testing the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why do we have to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        "- to check the data is clean without outliers and unnecessary values and to handle missing values so that when used for model training it wont be complex for the model to process the pattern so that the model could be accurate by doing EDA before model fitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is correlation?\n",
        "- is a comparision that two variables are linearly related or not and which is highly related is considered as a feature in model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What does a negative correlation mean?\n",
        "- negative correlation means if the values are between -1 to 0 then it is said to be negative correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How can you find the correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        "- using np.corr which helps to find the correlation between variables like if the data is between -1 to 0 then it is negative correlation and if the value is between 0 to 1 then it is positively correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is causation? Explain the difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        "- causation means an event directly leads to another cause.\n",
        "- correlation is one might increase and other decrease and there is no cause between the two.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is an optimizer? What are the different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n",
        "- an optimizer adjusts the parameters like weights, bias to increase the model's performance.\n",
        "- Gradient Descent: it helps the algorithm to slowly updates the model's parameter in the direction of steepest or ascent of the loss function ex: hiker trying to reach the bottom of the valley.\n",
        "- Stochastic Gradient Descent: it iterates over a randomly selected data point and updates the parameter based on the gradient calculated but makes more noise. ex: instead of selecting all the data points it selects the random data point to compute the gradient.\n",
        "- Adam: it is an adaptive learning optimizer which uses the advantages of rmsprop and momentum ex: it uses moving averages of past gradients and their squares to adjust the learning of each parameter.\n",
        "- RMSprop: it is also similar to adam but it uses moving average of gradients ex: it maintains the exponential square of past gradients and normalize the current gradient.\n",
        "- Adagrad: it adapts the learning rate to optimize each parameter individually and takes the squares of past gradients and adjusts the learning rate. ex: parameters which are adjusted recently have a larger learning rate and which are from past will have a smaller elarning rate.\n",

        "19. What is `sklearn.linear_model`?\n",
        "- is a library in sklean which provides a variety of models in linear regression and classification tasks.\n",

        "23. What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?\n",
        "- feature scaling is used to optimize the features or variables in a data set to bring them in a same scale and it is helpfull in optimization and decreases complexity and most of the algorithms are distance based, if high magnitude values comes it makes computationally expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do we perform feature scaling in Python?\n",
